## About this Repository

This is a Selene bundle defining tiles and entities as seen in the open source online
roleplaying game Illarion.

This bundle depends on an asset bundle providing the graphics and visual definitions referenced in its data, i.e. it is
not self-contained. Due to licensing restrictions, any graphics or related assets are not included.

The original sources used to derive this data can be found under https://github.com/Illarion-eV.
